## Description

Have a look at this message I found in an old chest. I also found its key. `key = [24, 28, 110, 126, 145, 200, 209, 222, 231, 332, 447, 460, 472, 476, 480, 569, 591, 629, 633, 650, 671, 695, 696, 699, 706, 833]`. Can you decrypt it? Don't forget to put the `ictf{}` wrapper around before submitting the flag.
